### Hi, I'm Sam
_Software Engineer & Designer_

---

I’ve been a product designer since around 2012, however **I'm currently working as a freelance software engineer**. I still do a bit of product design for the right project, I haven't quite lost my Figma skills yet!

In my design career, I've worked on improving accessibility in healthcare, democratising processes and workflows for internal teams, and building design systems that enabled teams to efficiently ship products faster.

In March 2022, I left the world of full-time product design and set up [Sam King Studio](https://samking.studio). I've always written code alongside my design practice, and started to find it more interesting with the advent of web3. The fact I could build a front-end and hook it up to a public immutable network was fascinating to me. Since then I've worked on a few things, helping teams release their NFT projects, built some gaming smart contracts, and put out a couple of my own photography projects. It's been a lot of fun!

### I'm currently available for new projects.

I’m looking to work with people, not for them. I want to help bring people’s ideas to life. I want to create work that’s accessible. I want to create work for public good. I want to explore new mediums and technology, while also being part of positive change.

If that sounds like your project or idea, I’d love to hear about it! Send me a DM on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/samkingco) or visit the [studio website](https://samking.studio) for more ways to get in touch.
