### Hi, I'm Sam
_Software Engineer & Designer_

---

Iâ€™ve been a Product Designer since 2012 where I mainly focused on improving accessibility in healthcare, democratising processes and workflows for internal teams, and building design systems that enabled teams to ship products faster.

However I'm now focusing more on the Software Engineering side and have a fair bit of experience with the TypeScript, React and general frontend ecosystem. I'm also comfortable with Solidity, and I'm learning more about backend and databases etc. as I build [Refrakt.app](https://refrakt.app).
